# Movie Rental - ConstraintLayout Workshop ([back to main](https://github.com/ErikHellman/ConstraintLayoutWorkshop/tree/master))

The task is to create two XML layouts using ConstraintLayout, and animate between them as shown in the picture below.

Animations like this are done using [`ConstraintSet`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/constraint/ConstraintSet.html) and the [TransitionManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/transition/TransitionManager.html) from the support library.
