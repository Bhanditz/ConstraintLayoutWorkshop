# ConstraintLayout Workshop

This repository is the base for a workshop where you will learn how to use ConstraintLayout efficiently in Android development. 

The workshop is constructed of a number of tasks which each focus on a specific part. The tasks are sorted under different branches in this repository. Images for each part are added to the project. 

- [Refactoring from RelativeLayout and LinearLayout](refactoring) 

Refactor the `activity_main.xml` so that it uses only a single `ConstraintLayout`.

- [Movie Rental screen](movie_rental)

The task is to create two XML layouts using ConstraintLayout, and animate between them as shown in the picture below.
